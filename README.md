## Description
-  Create a simple quiz that displays top scores
- Started by creating all the html elements that were going to be needed and seperating out the different sections that were going to be needed. 
- JS was created to form interactions on the page, such as cycling through questions and answers
- An object with and array was created to house all the questions, choices, and answers
- Different functions were created to active the different stages of the quiz, from start to answering questions to subbinting your name.
- The last score recorded in the list is displayed in the top left corner of the screen and the timer is on the top right.
